# .emacs
My emacs config files, the important ones.

The most important file is .emacs .

Config ways on different platforms(OSX, or linux) are a little different. Some more .el files are surely required. On linux, some installs through terminal is enough(maybe), but on OSX, MELPA is probably a better way. Sometimes downloading packages from github is needed. They have their own .git and I don't think it's a good idea to include them in this repo.
